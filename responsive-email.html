        <p>Hi, xxxx,</p>
        <p>We received your inquiry, so this is just a holdover to say thanks for reaching out. We're not into the belabored formalities of never-ending email exchanges, so if you'd prefer to chat via phone, skype, or face-to-face over coffee, we're happy to set up a time to discuss your brand's challenges. If that's the case, then respond to this email with dates and times that work for you and we will get a meeting on the books.</p>
        <p>If that's not your thing, we're happy to completely abandon our original statement and email back and forth until we fully understand the nature of your project.</p>
        <p>Above all, thank you for taking the time to check us out. We look forward to hopefully building something together that creates lasting impact and success.</p>
        <p>All the best,</p>
        <p>BS LLC</p>
